# Spotify

Using the Spotify public API, create an iPhone app which allows a user to search for albums. Among the things the app should do: 

•	Allow the user to search by album name
•	Display ~10 albums, with cover art and album name in some sort of scrolling view (i.e. a table view or collection view)
•	Album layout should look good in portrait and landscape

You may use Swift or Objective-C. Feel free to use any and all reference material available to you, but be careful about copying code indiscriminately. You may be asked to describe your logic and explain your decisions.

Bonus points for adding unit tests, where appropriate. Also, code in such a way that you will be able to easily add functionality later. We will be working with you on this app as part of the interview process.

None of the APIs for this exercise require authorization or a token. The links below will lead you to documentation for the API you will need to use:
